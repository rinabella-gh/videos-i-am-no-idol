# About

Transparency in advocacy is something I believe people should be less afraid of doing. One of the worst lies perpetuated by this country is that politics should inherently be divisive, polarizing, or embarassing to discuss. What I find people are really saying to me when they say "I don't want to get political", they really mean "I honestly don't know enough about this" or "the sources I back my opinion are embarassing (thinly veiled bigotry, random reddit posts, or just feelings or vibes)." And honestly, that's okay, we can't all be experts about everything. That's kinda what we have experts for, no? We all need people and sources that we identify as "trustworthy". 

Either way, by saying "I don't want to get political", I believe really we're saying "I've heard about this, but I don't want to learn more about it right now than I already have." And again, that's fine - some random conversation between friends is probably not the best place to learn anyways, much less some sort of livestream environment.

However, when do we take that time to learn? It's obviously affecting people enough that they want to talk about it; I think as people advocating for things online, whether that be consumer rights, video game preservations, gender and racial equity, or reform by other names, it is vital we are aware and educated on the key issues of our times.

And so in a roundabout way, as someone who wants to advocate for causes here on the internet, I want to take some time to teach others about *me*. And I don't mean in a vain, narcissistic manner - no, I want to talk about who I am, where I come from, and especially all the messy details. There is a fair bit that is problematic about me, and I would say that putting me on a pedestal would be a grave mistake. I am just another human like the rest of us, and I barely know myself. I'm still learning, frankly.

This video will be split up into a few different parts: my socioeconomic upbringing -- a sort of dry retelling of my life from an analytical perspective; my development psychologically, where I will talk about my suicidal ideations and the moment I realized I was trans; and finally my controversies, items in my past I am not proud of. I hope this will give context to viewers about who I am, where I come from, and what I'm all about.

Without further ado, let's get into the details of why I'm far from any sort of idol.

## Upbringing

So a good place to start is my socioeconomic upbringing. I was born in the 90s, in the midwest midwest to two parents, Jody and Paige, followed by a brother a few years later. My parents were in their mid to late 20s when they spawned us, and they came from families with not necessarily profound means, but means nonetheless. My grandma, for instance, had won two separate lotteries - but also had her house torn down by tornados three separate times. Still, we had money, and my parents could afford daycare or letting my grandma watch me on the weekends. We have never really struggled too hard with housing, although some situations may have been less than ideal.

My parents are both very loving towards their children... however, it soon became apparent that my parents were not great fits for each other. The marriage was deeply problematic, and after much, much consternation and discussion otherwise, my parents divorced. I went into the care of Jody, with visitation rights for Paige being preserved. For a while it was a little messy, where we were primarily living with my grandma, yet also living with Paige as well. Money was pretty tight around then, but eventually it ironed out to where we lived with Jody the full time. She eventually married Steve, my step-father, and that was my family unit as we grew up.

We lived in a townhouse for a good while, and then eventually, Jody and Steve were able to acquire a house. So, a family of means we were once more. We visited Paige regularly and we had a good time. I would say my home life stabilized when I was around 12-13.

At the age of 17-18, my parents got me a used Mazda 2, 2012. I loved that car and enjoyed it, but I didn't do much besides school to earn it. I graduated with the International Baccalaureate diploma at my high school, and then shortly went off to college.

At college, I got involved with a few campus organizations here and there, and I did a few odd jobs here and there, but I could not balance work and school. Thankfully, again, I came from a family of means and could focus on schoolwork without necessarily worrying about work, a privilege which I keep in mind each and every day. I graduated college with no debt.

And so, there is the very dry telling of the course my life took in my upbringing. My parents strived hard that for anything I asked for, within reason, I would be accomodated to some extent. By all accounts, I had an upbringing that most would be jealous of.  I have had a lot of privileges in my life that others do not, and I try to be as cognizant of that as I can be.


## Perspective

My own perspective on my life aligns much with what I shared earlier. However, there was severe parentification of me as a child - my parents, especially when married, fought very frequently or were otherwise absent due to mental blocks and issues. There was a lot of parentification of me as a kid; my brother jokes that I was the only parent and mediator, and I don't know if that's necessarily a joke. My parents, while one of them had anger issues, never really took it out on us physically, but I did have a daycare teacher that was pretty abusive towards me. So I think serving as the parent role helped me feel in control of the situation and for the most part, kept me out of trouble like that again.

If I think back on my very first thoughts, two things come to mind: 

1. I identified as a girl
2. A deep, profound sense that the only way to reconcile that physical disparity was to die.

Yeah, it's kinda wild, but seriously. One of my very first memories is playing with my AFAB cousins and realizing I wish I was allowed to do what they did; unfortunately, I was severely punished and admonished when I was young for acting as such, so I internalized that being a girl was impossible. And so, at a young age, I came to the conclusion that I would rather not live at all than not live as a girl.

But, I was responsible for my brother, and I couldn't leave him behind, so I stuck through it. My family might not know this actually, but I did honestly attempt to kill myself a couple times at elementary school. I'm laughing at the thought of it while writing because it sounds absurd, but I fell over and smashed my head into the concrete a few times trying to knock myself out. I couldn't have been older than 5 at the time.

So, the rest of my youth was spent on escapism, trying very hard to ignore the fact that I was transgender and suicidal. I dove into a lot of books and games to fill the void that was myself. I got really into Linux, free software systems, and TOR, because I knew what it meant for your life to be ruined if a secret were to be revealed...

I tried coming out a few times, and I had helped a few of my friends begin their transitions; but I kept stumbling and putting myself back in the box. I knew the process, but after being so profoundly afraid of transitioning, I didn't really think I was worth "the effort". My voice especially bothered me - my masculine voice is pretty low register and so I didn't think I had much hope for voice training efforts.

Eventually, in my mid 20s, I decided enough was enough - at most "the effort" was just some pills, who really cares about the voice, and then I made a plan to begin transitioning gender. I moved to Alaska to get away from my family for a bit to do so, and that was that. Lots of ad-hoc personal voice training for this mediocre voice (all I did was read AP news articles lol; for those wondering about the voice I'll do a separate video some day going over that), some hormone therapy later and this is what I got. I'm happy with the results, better than the alternative for sure.


Unfortunately, just because I have transitioned now, it doesn't suddenly just remove all of those suicidal ideations I had as a kid. It became my coping mechanism. Whenever I did anything wrong, it was just further proof that trying to live was a futile effort and I should just get it over and kill myself. Yet, it is a core part of who I am, and without being who I am I would not have the perspective and knowledge that I do have. So, I power on, despite it all.


## Controversies

Alright, so we've had two takes on my life - one from an "analytical" perspective, one from my "subjective", emotional perspective, and so now I'm going to put another bad habit of mine to work - what could others say they hated about me growing up?

I was pretty neglected as a kid in terms of social education. I was basically handed a game console and that was that. So I didn't really value a lot of norms. I think people generally liked me, but I was definitely weird and walked my own path. I went out of my way to befriend the kids people thought were "weird", and looking back, all of my friends that I made were LGBT of some form or fashion. It's interesting how we find each other when we don't have the words for it yet.

Anyways, I had a pretty uneventful childhood beyond that... High school, though, was a different story.

### High School

So, I was really struggling with depression at this point. Life didn't seem worth it. One big thing I did that I cringe looking back on, is that there was one time I just... didn't shower for like 6 months. I just didn't care. Nobody in my life complained or reprimanded me for it. I had a huge infection on the top of my head due to a zit that I kept picking; there was only one person who asked me about it, and I think of the look of concern on her face a lot. Eventually I just kept wearing the same clothes every day. 

I started showering and wearing different clothes when someone on the bus yelled at me for wearing the same pants for so long.

From this lack of self-care, there were a lot of complications I had to deal with. One of the biggest things is that I had developed Tinea Versicolor - basically a benign fungal infection all over the skin that caused discoloration. You couldn't really notice it unless you looked close, but, it was disgusting, and looked a lot like ringworm. I brought it up with my parents a couple times but they never really took me to the doctors. I finally got it addressed *after* I graduated college. Ugh...

So yeah, my lack of self care in high school was just terrible, and I understand completely if people thought I was a creep or terrible because of that.

I was also kinda just socially unaware. At another point, we had this reading class where we were supposed to take turns leading discussions for books we've read. I was a lout when it came to literature in high school, mostly because teachers I had made it extremely laborious and unfun. Anyways, when it came time for me to lead the discussion, I was pretty ruthless. We all had to speak in the class for us to get points, and there was this one girl who was refusing to talk. Unfortunately my laziness on the work in the class meant I was 1 or 2 points away from an F, so... I began hounding her to speak. Eventually, she did, but I had embarrassed her. The discussion ended, I got the full marks I needed to pass, and I went on with my day.

Later that day, however, one of my friends came up to me and laid out to me that I had made that girl cry in the bathroom after class. I still feel terrible about it, I didn't quite understand what was going on in their life, and I still don't, but I still think of this moment often. To some, this may seem like a small thing, but I don't really think so myself. If that person still hates me to this day for that, then I don't really blame them. I was really only looking out for myself, and I put her under the bus for that. I think the reason this sticks with me so much, and that it bothers me so, is that this is so antithetical to my beliefs. I'm very community and people oriented, so the fact that this happened just really bums me out.

Finally, the last controversy I can think of is sort of simple, but it was that I was really affectionate in public and around my friends with my partner. There were quite a few times we would just make out in front of them and honestly, if their friends found me creepy because of it, I don't really blame them. I'd say more but honestly I can't think of much else to say. At least we didn't do drugs, lol.

### College

And finally, we have controversial things I did in college. There's one really big situation I want to focus on, but there are other important things I did in college I would like to address:

1. There was one semester where I was interim president of College Democrats on my campus, and I did the most half assed job possible. The only reason the organization didn't get shut down due to lack of activity was because my friend Connor  happened to find someone actually interested in leading and building the chapter. They did a great job, but there were a lot of opportunities there for the org that I just squandered. It's frustrating looking back.
2. In freshmen year, there were a few times I said "fags" and "ni🅱️🅱️a (exactly as written". I was a janitor on 4chan briefly at this time and those were two phrases my floor community used a lot; I was finally coming to my terms with my queerness at this time. As for the other one, I really was thoughtless and careless when saying it, I viewed it totally separately than the n-word. Thankfully, my friend sat me down after saying it a couple times and explained that I was being fucking stupid by saying that, and to this day I think "fucking stupid" is putting it lightly...
3. I did have some hygiene issues again when me and my partner broke up, but not nearly as bad as I did in high school.
4. I was lazy with projects and kinda screwed a few things up for people here and there; I frequently withdrew from classes due to excessive suicidal ideation.
5. I gave verbal 2-weeks notice to my boss at Goodwill; she wanted me to give her a letter. Due to some sexual harassment I was getting at work, and after sleeping in on accident one morning, I just decided to no-show to the job and keep my phone off.
6. There were a couple friends who wanted to do business endeavors, I would hype them up and want to help, but when it came time for me to follow through I just... didn't.

I think that's it for the more self contained situations. So, now let's get on to the really bad moment, and why I don't think I should really be placed in executive positions.


### MACURH RLC

So, I was pretty involved in my residence hall organizations. To be clear, I find a lot of issues with Residence Halls on college campuses and how they are ran. My involvement was mostly to improve the halls, because my school mandated every student would have to stay on campus for at least 2 years. 

Anyways, I became a Resident Assistant, then a Programming Resource Assistant - basically I just tried my best to have the residence halls be a better, more equitable place. I made a lot of great friends during that time, and one of them, Connor, had a great idea: There are these conferences of residence halls across regions, and ours was MACURH - Midwest Affiliate of College & University Residence Halls I don't know, but I thought it would be fun to try and help bring the conference to campus. So I helped draft and I think even present the bid for the conference, and we actually won?

This meant then we needed to fill our chairs for the conference. I was the Programming chair; which basically meant all I needed to do was field requests for presentations at the conference and finalize the itinerary.

Unfortunately, I was still being irresponsible with my depression, and I just never got around doing my job. So, the weekend of this conference, I decided to just disappear. I turned my phone off, hid at a friend's house, and just never talked to the friends I had made involved with the conference again. It was real, real childish stuff.

From what I later heard, the conference went fine - my supervisor stepped in and saved the day, but I am sure it was real awkward for them to explain why their Programming Chair just... wasn't there and no one could get ahold of me.

It just weighs on my mind heavily. I had all the chances to say "Hey, I actually don't want to do this", but I just irresponsibly ghosted them. These were good friends of mine for years, and I treated them like they were disposable. Some of them had been my first friends on campus.

Sorry doesn't begin to make amends for what I did, but I am truly remorseful over how I approached this.

So, yeah. Just not my proudest moment, at all, and something that I think speaks to how irresponsibly I handled my mental illness even when I was aware of it.

## And What Came After

For the most part, that's about it for controversial things I've done. I did leave my last programming job with something apparently uncommitted, and I unintentionally freaked the management by explicitly saying I was leaving because I was having such intensely bad suicidal ideations and was going to commit myself to therapy. I was pretty frank with my director about that though, and I gave multiple months notice I was leaving, so I'm not sure where the disconnect was.

So, yeah. There you go. All the dirty gossip on me and my life, at least what I can think of right now. It's probably more than you wanted to know. It's not exactly comforting for me to put this out there, but what is comforting is knowing that you all know I'm not some paragon of virtue, and I don't pretend to be one. If there is someone from my past that has stuff to air against me, feel free to contact me and I can do a follow up correcting anything.
