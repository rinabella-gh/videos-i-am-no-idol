# About

- Transparency in advocacy is *crucial*
- It's okay to discuss politics
- We need to take the time to learn and vet our sources

# Purpose

- As an advocate, I want to provide insight into *me*
    - Where I come from
    - How I got here
    - And the mistakes I made a long the way
- This is all to inform you.

**I am no Idol**

# Upbringing 

- Born in the Midwest, 1990s.
- Have a younger brother who means the world to me.
- Came from a family of means.

# Upbringing (Childhood)

- Parents identified a need for divorce, and, eventually, divorced
- Money was tight for a few years during this time
   - Thankfully, we recovered due to the support of family
- Primary custody given to Jody, who re-married to a man named Steve
   - Regular visitation with Paige

# Upbringing (Adolescence)

- Primarly lived in a townhouse for a few years
- Eventually, acquired a house.
- Around 17-18, parents bought me a used Mazda 2.
- Things were stable, and earned my I.B. Diploma, then went to College.

# Upbringing (College)

- Was fairly involved on campus
- Did a few odd jobs here and there
    - Unfortunately could not balance work and school
    - Had to quit jobs, family was able to help, which I am eternally grateful for
- Eventually got my diploma and graduated without debt.

# Upbringing (In Summary)

- Extensive privilige coming from a family of means.
- All in all, a good childhood

# Personal Perspective

- Much of my personal perspective aligns with the previous analytical account
- Was parentified as a kid.
- Family does have history of mental illness
- Had an abusive daycare teacher

# Personal Perspective

- My first thoughts are pretty:
    -  I identified as a girl
    - A deep, profound sense that the only way to reconcile the physical disparity was to die.

# Personal Perspective

No, seriously.

Those are my first thoughts.

# Personal Perspective

- Sense of responsibility for my brother kept me here
- There was one point around 4-5 I repeatedly forced myself to fall on concrete
- Other than that, no real active attempts


# Personal Perspective

- Rest of my youth was spent on escapism, ignoring reality
- Lots of books and games
- Got into Linux and free software

# Personal Perspective

- I did try coming out a few times, but held myself back
- Helped friends through their transitions, but not mine
- I didn't really think I was worth "the effort"
    - Voice was a big blocker for me
    
# Personal Perspective

- Eventually, in mid 20s, enough was enough
- Moved away from family to Alaska to transition.
    - LOTS of voice training, lol.
    - Started Hormone therapy.
    

# Personal Perspective (In summary)

- Unfortunately, still have the suicidal ideation as a coping mechanism.
- But, very happy with how I've turned out, and who I am to this day.
- I continue through, despite it all

# Controversies

- We've gone through two takes on my life now:
    - One analytical
    - One subjective personal
- I will attempt to do a "subjective" view of me from other people as I grew up.
    - Since I am not them, I can only approximate them, but I will try my best.
    
# Controversies (Early youth)

- I was was pretty neglected in terms of social education
    - Was given books and a game console, and that was about it.
    - Wasn't really taught to value norms.
- I would say people generally liked me, but I was a bit weird.
- Went out of my way to befriend the other "weird kids"

# Controversies (Early youth)

Funny how, looking back, the "weird kids" I made friends with were all LGBT of some form or fashion.

# Controversies (Early youth)

Otherwise, uneventful. Not too much controversy until high school.

# Controversies (High School)

- Was basically restrained by intense depression
- There was a period I didn't shower for 6 months straight.
- Got pretty bad infections from it.
- Basically, self care in high school was just terrible


# Controversies (High School)

- Was also still very much unperturbed by some social norms
- Made a girl cry because I singled her lack of input in class out
    - I think this bothers me so much because I essentially profited at her expense

# Controversies (High School)

- Pretty simple, but was pretty affectionate in public with my partner

# Controversies (College)

Lot's of little things here.

1. Half-assed the College Democrats President position
2. Briefly used the f-slur and "nibba (exactly as written)" to be hip
3. Had some hygiene issues again after break up, but not as bad as high school.
4. Was lazy with projects and screwed a few things up for people
    - Frequently withdrew from classes due to excessive suicidal ideation
5. No showed to one of the odd jobs I did
6. Flaked on friends' bussiness endeavors

# Controversies (College, MACURH)

- Exceptionally involved in my residence hall organizations
    - Most of involvement was to better the campuses
- Became a Resident, served until I hit a term limit
- Made a lot of great friends

# Controversies (College, MACURH)

- One of my best friends I made was Connor; he came to me with an idea
- He wanted to bring the MACURH RLC to our university
- Drafted and presented the bid with him and the rest of the team
    - We won!

# Controversies (College, MACURH)

- After winning, we needed to fill the chairs for the conference
    - I was to be the Programming chair
    - All I really needed to do was field requests for presentations and finalize the itinerary.

# Controversies (College, MACURH)

- Unfortunately, still being very irresponsible with my depression.
- Never did the job I was supposed to do.
- The weekend of the conference, I decided to just disappear
    - Really, really childish stuff
    
# Controversies (College, MACURH)

- Thankfully, from what I gathered, the conference went fine - my supervisor stepped in and saved the day.
- Weighs on my mind heavily; I had abandoned some very, very close friends when they needed me.
- Not at all my proudest moment.

# And What Came After

- Did leave a job without committing something apparently
    - Also freaked management out by explicitly saying why I was leaving; I was pretty clear with my director thoughts
    - I gave multiple months notice as well.
- The rest is really petty internet stuff

**Thanks for your time.**
